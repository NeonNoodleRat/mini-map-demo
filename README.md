where you left off:
-got 100 of the rows in from appraisal_rolls
-used mapbox geocode api to get lat & longitude
-made local supabase database & table called "addresses_with_coords'
-loading those into this index.html file
-working on adding county lines, but i think i need a paid mapbox subscription for that (access to the mapbox boundaries api)
-was using claude code from the terminal with mapbox mcp devkit to made map style changes
